## Details
The fribblesFMRI_object-value-construction project contains three datasets of independent participants with the same experimental paradigm. One Behavioural sample, one fMRI-pilot sample and one fMRI sample.  
  
This repository contains:
* Codes to anlayze Behaviour and Eye-Tracking for the Behavioural sample (Matlab)
* Behavioural and Eye-Tracking data for the Behavioural sample
* Codes to anlayze Behaviour and Eye-Tracking for the fMRI sample (Matlab)
* Behavioural and Eye-Tracking data for the fMRI sample
* Codes to anlayze fMRI data and power calculation for the fMRI-pilot sample (Matalb and FSL)
* Codes to anlayze fMRI data for the fMRI sample : Fribbles_Bidding_Task and Functional_Localizer_Task fLOC (Matalb and FSL)
  
The raw fMRI data in BIDS format can be found at:
* OpenNeuro [LINK] for the fMRI-pilot sample
* OpenNeuro [LINK] for the fMRI sample

The non peer-reviewed manuscript which presents these data analyzed with these codes can be found at:

Hypotheses, data collection plan and detailed analyses were pre-registered at:
* Open Science Framework [project link osf.io/2jy6a] [pre-registration link osf.io/4d2yr]

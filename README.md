## Details
The fribblesFMRI_object-value-construction project contains three datasets of independent participants with the same experimental paradigm. One Behavioural sample, one fMRI-pilot sample and one fMRI sample.  
  
This repository contains:
* Codes to anlayze Behaviour and Eye-Tracking for the Behavioural sample (Matlab)
* Codes to anlayze Behaviour and Eye-Tracking for the fMRI sample (Matlab)
* Codes to anlayze fMRI data and power calculation for the fMRI-pilot sample (Matalb and FSL)
* Codes to anlayze fMRI data for the fMRI sample (Matalb and FSL)  
  
The raw fMRI data for the fMRI-pilot sample and the fMRI sample in BIDS format can be found at:
* OpenNeuro [LINK]  
  
The Eye-tracking data for the Behavioural sample and the and fMRI sample can be found at:
* ... [LINK]  

The non peer-reviewed manuscript which presents these data analyzed with these codes can be found at:

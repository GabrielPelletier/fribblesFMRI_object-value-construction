Notes on ROIs

LOC - Lateral Occipital complex
> Created using the HarvardOxford Lateral Occipital Complex-anterior division
> Binarized wtihout thresholding.
> Finding the subject's peak activity for the contrast Object>Srambled objects within this Atlas-ROI; finding one peak for each hemipshere.
> Draw a 10mm sphere around each peak

PPA - Parahippocampal place area
> Created using the HarvardOxford Parrahipocampal gyrus, Posterior & Anterior divisions
> Binarized wtihout thresholding.
> Finding the subject's peak activity for the contrast Places>Objects within this Atlas-ROI; finding one peak for each hemipshere.
> Draw a 10mm sphere around each peak

FFA - Fusiform Face Area
> Created using the HarvardOxford Temporal Occipital Fusiform Cortex
> Binarized wtihout thresholding
> Finding the subject's peak activity for the contrast Faces>Objects within this Atlas-ROI; finding one peak for each hemipshere.
> Draw a 10mm sphere around each peak

PRC
> Not from Visual Localizer.
> From J. Delvin's 2007 paper's probabilistic mask.
> Thresholded at > 30 percent, as in M. Barense's work
